# Hangman in Python
Building hangman with inexperienced programmers.

1. Let your group form smaller groups and have them brainstorm the core concepts of Hangman. Have them do this for a few minutes.
2. Bring the groups their brainstorms together. Try to recreate the all features with the entire group.
   - You can guide them in the right direction. Essential parts of hangman were laid out in [this file](hangman_core.md).
3. Teach them about the related programming concepts. Explain how they can recreate the game logic in Python.
4. Have them try to somewhat programmatically write out the game. This doesn't have to be in Python by default it could also just be a more code-like game logic structure.
